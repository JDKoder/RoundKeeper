RoundKeeper
===========
Essentially this is really a practice project for TDD/BDD.  So far so good.

For sanity's sake, all NPC/PC's (Non/Player-Characters) are henceforth referred to as Actors.
A round keeper for tabletop games where there is an initiative order. The interface provides controls to
- Add/Remove Actors to the intiative order on the fly
- Modify an Actors initiative on the fly.
- Track who's turn it is
- Add other statistics to be tracked
- Modify statistics of any Actors

On the agenda:
1. Convert to Maven project
2. Implement GUI

Currently working on converting this to a maven project.
